## Stuff about Lab 1 Review

A couple of thing hes noticed, some people didnt understand what parallalising is, you need to think about what you are parall....
Check that manual he sent out because it allows you to play with a bunch of stuff, we need to provide an understsanding of why it looks the way it looks, we were supposed to put in error bars in lab 1, you cant just measure the average, you lost variabliliy when you compress this data. Dive into the variability in the report itself, they wouldnt be able to tell you have averaged so the analysis dives into that stuff. PUT YOUR GRAPGS INTO THE REPORT, also include the source code. The lab assessments are not for marks. The threads to a partial amount of the solution. Maybe also include the complexity of it . Need some sort of actvity mask when you are trying to parallalise because they all use the same logic but how do they do it. Theres one output stream, there is a race condition. We need to have a lock on it to ensure you get the right output.
